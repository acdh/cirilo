cirilo
======
Cirilo is an application developed for content preservation and data curation in FEDORA-based repository systems. 
Content preservation and data curation include object creation and management, versioning, normalization and standards, 
and the choice of data formats. The client offers functionalities which are especially prone to be used as tools for mass 
operations on FEDORA objects, such as ingest or replacement processes. Cirilo uses a collection of predefined 
content models, which can be used without further adjustments for standard workflow scenarios like the management 
of collections of TEI objects. It encapsulates functions for the resolvement of place names or ontology concepts, thus 
semantically enriching resources in the digital archive. Various dissemination options can also be assigned with the client.
Cirilo is a contribution to the DARIAH-EU task “Reference Software Packages.
The source code of the client can be found at https://github.com/acdh/cirilo, the documentation is available at

Debian-based Linux-distributions can be downloaded from http://gams.uni-graz.at/archive-framework.
LaTeX and R are not automatically included in the installation process. To use the corresponding functionalities please install the packages texlive-full, r-base, r-base-dev and other needed R plugins.
